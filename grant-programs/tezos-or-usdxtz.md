## ‚åöÔ∏è Background

Tezos is an OG open-source blockchain developed around the concept of self-amendment, allowing token holders to vote on protocol upgrades. Development began in 2014, with the Tezos Foundation funding research and development from a $232 million ICO in 2017. Tezos operates on a proof-of-stake model, reducing energy consumption compared to proof-of-work systems. Its applications span NFTs, DeFi, DAOs, and gaming. The native token, XTZ, is stored in multiple wallets, with holders participating in governance votes.

### üó∫Ô∏è Ecosystem

Tezos supports a variety of applications including: ü™™ Non-fungible tokens (NFTs),  üí∏ Decentralized finance (DeFi), üè¶ Banking, ‰∑¨ Decentralized autonomous organizations (DAOs), üÜî Decentralized identifiers (DIDs), üéÆ Gaming.

### ü™ô Grant Program

The Tezos Foundation has teamed up with Granted, aiming together to support the development and launch of innovative user applications and games on the network. The program prioritizes projects that showcase potential as flagship applications on Tezos Network, particularly those aligned with open-source principles.&#x20;

ü™ß [Apply](https://www.getgranted.io/granted-application)! Granted and Tezos strongly encourages all projects contributing to the growth of the Aleph Zero ecosystem to share their projects with us, especially those that fit under any categories known to be prioritized by the community.&#x20;

### üß± Tech Stack

Tezos's tech stack includes:

* Multiple high-level languages (JavaScript/TypeScript, Python, OCaml)
* Proof of stake consensus model
* Support for various digital asset types
* Stakeholder-led governance
* An upgradeable platform with on-chain improvements
*   Formal verification for code security and correctness.

    Formal verification on Tezos involves using mathematical proofs to verify the correctness of smart contracts. This method ensures that the code behaves as intended, significantly reducing the risk of bugs and vulnerabilities. Tezos's architecture and language ([Michelson](https://www.michelson.org/)) are designed to facilitate this process, making it a more secure platform for developing and deploying smart contracts. By providing a higher assurance of code safety, formal verification on Tezos attracts developers looking to create reliable and trustworthy applications.

### üõ£Ô∏è Roadmap

The recent developments in Tezos's roadmap emphasize a commitment to scalability and interoperability, with a focus on the following:

* **Performance Enhancement:** Aiming for high throughput, low latency, and lower fees.
* **Composability:** Simplifying asset and information transfer between protocols.
* **Decentralization:** Ensuring network stability and distributed control.
* **Interoperability:** Smooth integration of various systems and languages.
* **Improved Developer Experience:** Providing a user-friendly environment for builders.

The Ultra High Throughput (UHT) rollup is a major feature, which will make Tezos's layer 1 lighter and more efficient, decreasing latency and simplifying consensus processes. This is part of a broader strategy to increase transaction speed and efficiency, indicating a significant evolution in Tezos's capabilities and a move towards a more advanced blockchain ecosystem.

### üé≠ Community

The Tezos community comprises developers, businesses, and users globally, all contributing to the digital commonwealth. The community is actively involved in developing, staking, and governance, ensuring a decentralized and collaborative environment.
