## Aleph Zero | AZERO

Aleph Zero is a ZK-based privacy-enhancing, scalable, and decentralized blockchain platform designed for fast and secure transactions and DApps. It often emphasizes advanced cryptographic techniques and a novel consensus mechanism to provide a high level of security, scalability, and speed.

**Token: AZERO** ([coingecko](https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/aleph-zero))

## Background

Aleph Zero, a permissionless Layer-1 blockchain, was conceived by a team of mathematicians, computer scientists, and business experts and launched in late 2021. It was designed to address the blockchain trilemma by offering a scalable, secure, and decentralized platform. The project, rooted in academic rigor, was built around a peer-reviewed consensus protocol known as AlephBFT, utilizing Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) technology. This foundational work aimed to resolve the blockchain trilemma, balancing scalability, security, and decentralization, with early development integrating advanced technologies like zero-knowledge proofs and secure multi-party computation to ensure privacy and security.

Aleph Zero's successful Mainnet launch in 2021 marked a significant step in community expansion and ongoing development. Aleph Zero introduced Liminal, a software-based multichain privacy layer utilizing zero-knowledge proofs (ZK-SNARKs) and Secure Multiparty Computation (sMPC) to enhance user data protection. This development was well-received, enabling private and secure transactions suitable for sensitive sectors like banking and healthcare. Further advancing its technology, Aleph Zero recently introduced ink! 4.0 smart contracts on its Mainnet, a Rust-based eDSL for writing Wasm smart contracts. Ink! 4.0 brings new features and improvements, enhancing smart contract performance, security, and usability, thereby fostering a more efficient and developer-friendly environment for decentralized applications.

## Core Features

### **High-Speed Validation and Scalability**

_Rapid Transaction Processing_: As of December 2023, Aleph Zero is known to achieve validation times of 416 milliseconds for a significant volume of transactions, specifically 89,600 transactions per second (TPS), during tests. This is facilitated by the network's deployment across 112 Amazon Web Services (AWS) nodes spanning five continents. Such high-speed processing showcases Aleph Zero's capability to handle large-scale operations efficiently.

_Scalability_: The use of Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) technology, coupled with the AlephBFT consensus protocol, allows Aleph Zero to maintain high transaction throughput while ensuring security and decentralization. This makes it a suitable platform for businesses and enterprises seeking scalable blockchain solutions.

### **Enhanced Privacy with ZKPs and sMPC**

_**Zero-Knowledge Proofs (ZKPs)**_: Aleph Zero employs ZK-SNARKs to allow users to prove the validity of transactions without revealing the actual data involved. This technology is key to maintaining privacy and security on the network.

_**Secure Multi-Party Computation (sMPC)**_: Complementing ZKPs, sMPC allows data to be processed by multiple parties without any single party having access to the complete data set. This adds an extra layer of privacy and security, making Aleph Zero ideal for applications requiring confidential computations.&#x20;

_**Privacy:**_ With [Liminal](https://alephzero.org/ecosystem/)_,_ a native privacy framework on Aleph Zero utilizing ZK-SNARKs and sMPC to facilitate secure and private transactions and interactions on the blockchain, acting as a cornerstone for privacy-centric applications and services within the ecosystem.

### **"Hub and Spoke" Model for Customizable Business Solutions**

Aleph Zero introduces a "hub and spoke" model where businesses can maintain a private instance or 'spoke' that interacts with the main 'hub' or decentralized ledger. This model allows businesses to engage in trustless and efficient interactions while retaining privacy and control over their networks.

### **AlephBFT Consensus Protocol**

_Based on a DAG_: AlephBFT is an innovative consensus protocol that employs Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) technology. This not only ensures high transaction throughput and speed but also maintains a high degree of security and decentralization, making Aleph Zero a scalable and robust platform.

### **Liminal Privacy Framework**

_Advanced Cryptographic Techniques_: Liminal uses zero-knowledge proofs (ZK-SNARKs) and secure multi-party computation (sMPC) to provide a flexible and robust privacy layer. It supports a wide range of use cases from private transactions to complex dApps, making it ideal for sectors where privacy is crucial, like finance and healthcare.

### **Ink! 4.0 for Smart Contracts**

_Enhanced Smart Contract Environment_: Ink! 4.0, a Rust-based eDSL, is designed for writing Wasm smart contracts on Substrate-based blockchains like Aleph Zero. The update brings significant improvements in performance, security, and usability, making the development of decentralized applications more efficient and user-friendly.
