## ‚åöÔ∏è Background

Aleph Zero, launched in late 2021, is a permissionless Layer-1 blockchain developed by a team of mathematicians, computer scientists, and business experts to address the blockchain trilemma, offering a scalable, secure, and decentralized platform. Built around the peer-reviewed AlephBFT consensus protocol and utilizing DAG technology, it integrates advanced technologies like zero-knowledge proofs and secure multi-party computation to ensure privacy and security. The successful mainnet launch marked a pivotal moment for community growth and technological advancement, introducing Liminal, a multichain privacy layer enhancing data protection. Aleph Zero's recent release of ink! 4.0 smart contracts on its mainnet further advances its capabilities, offering improved performance, security, and usability for developers and users alike.

## ü™ô Grant Program

To foster further expansion and attract more developers, Aleph Zero has partnered with Granted to provide grants and resources to support emerging projects in the ecosystem.&#x20;

The Granted team is especially keen on backing teams dedicated to exploiting Aleph Zero's distinctive capabilities. This includes a variety of applications, from innovative uses of ZK-SNARKs and DeFi scenarios to enhancements within the network itself.

ü™ß [Apply](https://www.getgranted.io/granted-application)! Granted and Aleph Zero strongly encourages all projects contributing to the growth of the Aleph Zero ecosystem to share their projects with us, especially those that fit under any categories known to be prioritized by the community.&#x20;

## üß± Tech Stack

**Substrate:** Aleph Zero's tech stack is anchored by Substrate, a versatile framework offering modularity and flexibility, which enables rapid development and customization of the blockchain's key features using pre-built modules for essential functionalities called pallets, supports Wasm smart contracts through ink! 4.0 for secure and efficient dApp development, and allows forkless upgrades for seamless network evolution.

_**Infrastructure**_**:** As of December 2023, Aleph Zero is known to achieve validation times of 416 milliseconds for a significant volume of transactions, specifically 89,600 transactions per second (TPS), during tests. This is facilitated by the network's deployment across 112 Amazon Web Services (AWS) nodes spanning five continents. Such high-speed processing showcases Aleph Zero's capability to handle large-scale operations efficiently.

_**Zero-Knowledge Proofs (ZKPs)**_: Aleph Zero employs ZK-SNARKs to allow users to prove the validity of transactions without revealing the actual data involved. This technology is key to maintaining privacy and security on the network.

**Ink! 4.0 for Smart Contracts:** Ink! 4.0, a Rust-based eDSL, is designed for writing Wasm smart contracts on Substrate-based blockchains like Aleph Zero. The update brings significant improvements in performance, security, and usability, making the development of decentralized applications more efficient and user-friendly.

**AlephBFT Consensus Protocol:** _Based on a DAG_: AlephBFT is an innovative consensus protocol that employs Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) technology. This not only ensures high transaction throughput and speed but also maintains a high degree of security and decentralization, making Aleph Zero a scalable and robust platform.

_**Secure Multi-Party Computation (sMPC)**_: Complementing ZKPs, sMPC allows data to be processed by multiple parties without any single party having access to the complete data set. This adds an extra layer of privacy and security, making Aleph Zero ideal for applications requiring confidential computations.&#x20;

_**Privacy:**_ With [Liminal](https://alephzero.org/ecosystem/)_,_ a native privacy framework on Aleph Zero utilizing ZK-SNARKs and sMPC to facilitate secure and private transactions and interactions on the blockchain, acting as a cornerstone for privacy-centric applications and services within the ecosystem.

**"Hub and Spoke":** Aleph Zero introduces a "hub and spoke" model where businesses can maintain a private instance or 'spoke' that interacts with the main 'hub' or decentralized ledger. This model allows businesses to engage in trustless and efficient interactions while retaining privacy and control over their networks.

_**Scalable DAG**_**:** The use of Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) technology, coupled with the AlephBFT consensus protocol, allows Aleph Zero to maintain high transaction throughput while ensuring security and decentralization. This makes it a suitable platform for businesses and enterprises seeking scalable blockchain solutions.

## üõ£Ô∏è Roadmap

Aleph Zero's development is structured into distinct phases, of which we are currently in **Phase 4/5.**
