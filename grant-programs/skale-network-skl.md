## Tech Stack

The SKALE Network is a sophisticated blockchain platform designed to enhance the scalability and functionality of Ethereum and other blockchains. A breakdown of its core components include:

1. **Elastic Sidechains**: These are configurable blockchains that work alongside the main Ethereum chain. They allow developers to run decentralized applications (dApps) more efficiently by improving scalability, reducing latency, and lowering transaction costs. Each elastic sidechain can be thought of as a separate blockchain with its own consensus mechanism, which is fully compatible with Ethereum.
2. **SKALE Manager**: This is the main contract that operates on the Ethereum mainnet and coordinates between all the SKALE nodes and sidechains. It handles tasks like node registration, random node selection for chains, token operations, and more, essentially acting as the "brain" of the SKALE Network.
3. **Consensus Mechanism**: SKALE uses a variant of the Practical Byzantine Fault Tolerance (PBFT) consensus combined with an asynchronous binary Byzantine agreement to secure its network. This helps in achieving high throughput and low-latency block times while ensuring the security and integrity of the network.
4. **Metaport**: Metaport 2.0 is an update to the UI layer of the IMA (Interchain Messaging Agent) Bridge. It streamlines the account connection process using RainbowKit and facilitates multichain transfers, allowing for a more seamless user experience and efficient interaction between different chains. \[[8](https://skale.space/blog/skale-q3-2023-engineering-update)]
5. **Levitation Protocol**: Introduced in 2023, the Levitation Protocol is an open-source solution aiming to enhance the network with flexible and configurable zero-knowledge (ZK) scaling solutions. It includes the addition of a new Layer 1 blockchain called SKALE G, fortified by ZK Rollups. This protocol allows for seamless integration of various ZK proofs into the SKALE architecture, offering increased flexibility for developers and applications within the SKALE app-chain network. \[[9](https://blog.stakin.com/skales-impact-on-the-future-of-blockchain-and-web3/)]
6. **Zero-Knowledge Proofs (ZK Proofs)**: ZK Proofs are a form of cryptographic proof that allows one party to prove to another that a statement is true without revealing any information beyond the validity of the statement itself. SKALE's implementation of ZK proofs, especially within the Levitation Protocol, aims to enhance privacy and scalability across its network.
7. **SKALE Daemon**: This software runs on each node in the SKALE Network and is responsible for managing containers, sChains, and various other network functions. It helps ensure the smooth operation and communication of the individual nodes that power the network.
8. **Node Core**: Each node in the SKALE Network runs the Node Core software, which includes the SKALE Daemon, consensus implementation, and other essential components. These nodes work together to provide the computational resources needed to support the elastic sidechains.
9. **Interchain Messaging Agent (IMA)**: IMA enables the direct transfer of messages, tokens, and states between SKALE Chains and the Ethereum mainnet. This interoperability feature is crucial for seamless operation and integration with the broader Ethereum ecosystem.

These components work together to provide a layered, configurable, and efficient environment for developers to build and deploy scalable dApps. The SKALE Network continues to evolve, with ongoing updates and improvements aimed at enhancing its performance, usability, and functionality in the blockchain ecosystem. Below, we‚Äôll take a look at what‚Äôs in the pipeline for SKALE.

## Roadmap

**SKALE Network:** SKALE‚Äôs next release (v2.3) will focus on updating compatibility with the Ethereum Virtual Machine JSON-RPC API, improving validator services, and expanding transaction broadcasting capabilities. This release aims to provide more streamlined development and deployment processes for developers.

**Metaport 2.0:** A major update to the user interface layer of the IMA Bridge, Metaport 2.0, has been released. It incorporates RainbowKit for a more unified account connection procedure and facilitates multichain transfers. The update also brings technical refinements and a sleeker user interface, enhancing overall usability.

**The Levitation Protocol:** The SKALE Network's Levitation Protocol represents an ambitious step forward in the blockchain's scalability and security. The Levitation Protocol roadmap for 2024 includes:

1. **SKALE G (Ganymede)**: Introduction of SKALE G, a fast and scalable decentralized Layer 1 blockchain featuring L2 Zero-Knowledge (ZK) hooks back to Ethereum, allowing developers to utilize cutting-edge technology while maintaining a connection to the Ethereum network. App-Chains within the SKALE ecosystem will have the option to use fast, gas-free transactions on SKALE or to use Layer 2 ZK solutions in a configurable manner \[[10](https://skale.space/blog/introducing-the-levitation-protocol-skales-solution-for-decentralized-zero-knowledge-proofs)].
2. **Decentralization and Interoperability**: Unlike current centralized ZK protocols, Levitation will implement a decentralized sequencer as a set of smart contracts on a SKALE Chain. This architecture is designed to make existing ZK Rollups (ZKRs) decentralized without modifying the underlying software. It will also enable different ZKRs to interact seamlessly and run in a common environment, thus providing a common ledger of transactions and facilitating the interaction of rollups„Äê[11](https://skale.space/blog/introducing-the-levitation-protocol-skales-solution-for-decentralized-zero-knowledge-proofs)„Äë.
3. **Testnet and Mainnet Launch**: The Levitation Protocol has been under research and development by the SKALE community's open-source research team and core engineers. A public testnet was anticipated for later in 2023, with the mainnet launch scheduled for the fourth quarter of 2023. This timeline is subject to change based on the contributions and alignment of open-source contributors to the SKALE Project \[[12](https://skale.space/blog/introducing-the-levitation-protocol-skales-solution-for-decentralized-zero-knowledge-proofs)] \[[13](https://www.theblock.co/post/232622/skale-network-introduces-ethereum-zk-rollup-levitation-protocol)].

## **Community**

The development and deployment of the Levitation Protocol and other core components of SKALE network are governed by the SKALE community, including developers, stakers, and other community members. The final push to live production will require a successful on-chain voting„Äê[14](https://skale.space/blog/introducing-the-levitation-protocol-skales-solution-for-decentralized-zero-knowledge-proofs)„Äë.
