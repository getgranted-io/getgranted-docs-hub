# üêé BNB Chain | BNB

## ‚ùñ BNB Chain | BNB

Build and Build Chain, aka BNB Chain, is a permissionless and decentralized dual-chain environment powered by a unique consensus mechanism that blends the efficiency and security of Proof of Staked Authority (PoSA).&#x20;

Key attributes of the BNB Chain include its dual-chain architecture, which consists of the [BNB Beacon Chain](https://docs.bnbchain.org/docs/learn/beaconIntro/) for governance, staking, and voting alongside the [BNB Smart Chain](https://docs.bnbchain.org/docs/learn/intro/). This EVM-compatible chain fosters programmability and interoperability. Innovations such as [zkBNB](https://docs.bnbchain.org/zkBNB-docs/) and [opBNB](https://docs.bnbchain.org/opbnb-docs/) offer solutions for scalability and cost, with zkBNB utilizing zk-Rollup architecture for enhanced throughput and opBNB providing a Layer 2 scaling solution based on [Optimism's opStack](https://docs.optimism.io/). [BNB Greenfield](https://greenfield.bnbchain.org/docs/guide/introduction/overview.html) further enriches the ecosystem by redefining data ownership and monetization in the Web3 era, prioritizing user empowerment.

## ‚åöÔ∏è Background

Launched in 2017, the BNB token and Binance cryptocurrency exchange quickly evolved from an ERC-20 token on Ethereum to spearhead the Binance Smart Chain (BSC) in 2020. BSC's emergence, characterized by swift transactions, minimal costs, and EVM compatibility, positioned it as a cornerstone of the DeFi revolution, especially as Ethereum grappled with congestion. The 2022 rebranding to BNB Smart Chain marked its pivotal role in the expansive BNB Chain ecosystem. It integrates governance, smart contract execution, scaling solutions, and decentralized data storage into a cohesive platform.

Highlighting its scalability and efficiency, BNB Smart Chain achieved a remarkable milestone with a record 32,682,639 transactions in a single day on December 7, 2023. This feat demonstrates the chain's robust infrastructure and cements its status as a premier destination for developers and users seeking a high-performance blockchain ecosystem. The BNB Chain, with its comprehensive suite of services, remains committed to fostering a decentralized future, empowering creators, and envisioning a blockchain-enabled world for over a billion users.

## üß± Tech Stack

The core of the BNB Chain can be broken into the following components:

**BNB Beacon Chain (BC)** serves as the governance layer of the BNB ecosystem. It manages staking and voting mechanisms, ensuring the network's security and aligning with community governance.

**BNB Smart Chain (BSC)** provides developers with an EVM-compatible smart contract system. It enables seamless migration of DApps from Ethereum and offers programmability and interoperability within the BNB ecosystem and beyond.

**zkBNB** allows developers to create large-scale BSC-based applications with higher throughput and significantly lower, or even zero, transaction fees.

**opBNB is** a Layer 2 scaling solution for the BNB Smart Chain powered by the bedrock version of Optimism's opStack. It enhances the chain's performance and scalability.

**BNB Greenfield brings** ownership, usage, and monetization to BNB data, enabling users and all participants in the BNB Chain ecosystem to have first and foremost control over their data. This fosters a decentralized and user-centric data economy.

#### **Smart Contracts - Solidity Programming Language**

The BNB Chain primarily supports the [Solidity programming language](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity) for smart contract development, mainly through its BNB Smart Chain (BSC) component. Solidity is a statically typed programming language designed for developing smart contracts that run on the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM). It allows developers to write business logic in contracts that govern transactions, interactions, and applications on the blockchain. It is the most widely used language for developing smart contracts on Ethereum-compatible blockchains, including the BNB Smart Chain.

#### **Development and Testing**

[**Hardhat**](https://hardhat.org) is an Ethereum development environment compatible with BNB Chain. It allows developers to compile, deploy, test, and debug their Ethereum software.

[**Truffle Suite**](https://www.trufflesuite.com/) is a development environment, testing framework, and asset pipeline for blockchains using the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM), making it suitable for development on the BNB Chain. Truffle aims to simplify developers' lives by providing tools to help build decentralized applications.

[**Moralis**](https://moralis.io/) **is a** fully managed backend infrastructure that simplifies creating dApps on BNB Chain and other blockchains. Moralis provides a suite of authentication, database management, and real-time event monitoring tools.

Additionally, developers can interact with the BNB Chain using other programming languages through client libraries and SDKs, which facilitate the development of applications and services that communicate with the blockchain. Some of these include:

**JavaScript**: [Web3.js](https://web3js.readthedocs.io/) and [Ethers.js ](https://docs.ethers.org/v5/)are popular JavaScript libraries for interacting with Ethereum and BNB Smart Chain. They allow developers to deploy contracts, interact with smart contracts, and manage accounts in JavaScript.

**Python**: [Web3.py](http://web3.py/) is a library that interacts with Ethereum and, by extension, BNB Smart Chain. It's used for purposes similar to its JavaScript counterparts, enabling Python developers to work with the blockchain.

**Go**: The [Go Ethereum GitHub](https://github.com/ethereum/go-ethereum) client (geth) provides a Go package to interact with Ethereum and EVM-compatible blockchains like BNB Smart Chain. It's useful for developers working on backend services that interact with the blockchain.

### Consensus Mechanism

The BNB Chain employs the Proof of Staked Authority (PoSA) consensus mechanism, blending elements of Proof of Authority (PoA) and Delegated Proof of Stake (DPoS). This hybrid approach enables fast, efficient, and secure transaction processing by allowing selected validators to confirm transactions and produce blocks, ensuring high throughput and network integrity.

**Tendermint**\
[Tendermint consensus](https://docs.tendermint.com/v0.34/introduction/what-is-tendermint.html) is a foundational technology for building blockchain systems, known for its high performance, security, and fault tolerance. It is a [Byzantine Fault Tolerant](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Byzantine\_fault) (BFT) consensus algorithm designed to enable decentralized networks to agree on a single version of the truth, even in the presence of malicious actors, as long as less than one-third of the nodes are faulty. Tendermint is notable for its ability to facilitate rapid finality of transactions, meaning that once a block is added to the blockchain, it is considered final and irreversible, eliminating the need for multiple confirmations.

At the core of Tendermint's design is separating the blockchain's application and consensus layers. This modular architecture allows developers to build custom blockchain applications (dubbed "state machines") in any programming language, which communicate with the consensus layer via the Application Blockchain Interface (ABCI). This separation enhances flexibility and ease of development, making Tendermint a popular choice for building a wide range of decentralized applications and private blockchains. Tendermint consensus powers the Cosmos Network, enabling various independent blockchains to interoperate and share data securely and scalable, thus fostering a decentralized internet of blockchains.

**Staking**

[Staking](https://docs.bnbchain.org/docs/beaconchain/learn/bc-staking/#posa-consensus-of-bnb-smart-chain) on the BNB Chain is intricately designed to integrate seamlessly with its operational framework, mirroring systems like the Cosmos Hub that utilize Tendermint consensus for automatic reward distribution. Staking operations occur on the BNB Beacon Chain (BC), facilitating a unified approach to validator selection and voting power adjustments via cross-chain communication. Staking with BNB tokens involves bonding and delegation actions recorded on BC, with daily updates to the BSC validator set and reward distributions managed through a dedicated staking module. This ecosystem ensures validators are ranked and rewarded based on their delegated tokens, with rewards transferred from BSC to BC for distribution, highlighting a cohesive and efficient staking economy within the BNB Chain.

**Validators**

BNB Smart Chain (BSC) validators are essential for processing transactions and securing the network, earning transaction fee rewards for their contributions. Rewards are distributed daily but are accumulated in a contract rather than sent directly to validators. Validators risk "Slashing" penalties for misconduct such as double signing or failing to maintain network communication, with penalties affecting only their stakes, not their delegators'.

The selection process for validators involves staking BNB, with the [top 40 highest-stake nodes](https://bscscan.com/validators) chosen every 24 hours from candidates who meet a minimum self-delegation of 2000 BNB. BSC's governance mechanisms, including slashing and jailing, deter bad behavior by making malicious actions costly and ensuring that penalties are applied only to the validators' stakes, thereby maintaining network integrity and fairness.
