## üß± Tech Stack

### Avalanche Primary Network/Mainnet

Avalanche's Primary Network is a diverse ecosystem comprising three separate blockchains, coming together to form the Avalanche Mainnet, which includes the Primary Network and all deployed subnets. The Primary Network consists of three leading chains:

1. **Contract Chain (C-Chain)**: Implements the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM), allowing for the deployment and execution of smart contracts written in Solidity. It is designed to be compatible with Ethereum's development tools and practices.
2. **Platform Chain (P-Chain)**: Manages validator and subnet operations, including creating new blockchains and subnets, adding validators to subnets, and conducting staking operations. It acts as the backbone of the network's structure and validator coordination.
3. **Exchange Chain (X-Chain)**: Handles digital smart assets known as Avalanche Native Tokens, which can represent real-world resources with specific rules. This chain supports creating and exchanging these tokens, with AVAX being the primary asset for transaction fees.

### Consensus Mechanism

The Avalanche Consensus mechanism is a state-of-the-art blockchain network protocol focusing on scalability, durability, and decentralization. It integrates the best aspects of classical and Nakamoto consensus mechanisms, ensuring swift, secure consensus among nodes. Key elements of the Avalanche Consensus include:

* **Mechanism**: Utilizes sub-sampled voting, where nodes consult a random subset of validators to decide on transaction validity. This method ensures rapid and efficient consensus, with safeguards to exclude invalid transactions, like those exceeding the account's AVAX balance.
* **Consensus Achievement**: Defined by two adjustable parameters: "Œ±" (alpha) for the required majority and "Œ≤" (beta) for the confidence threshold or consecutive rounds needed. This flexibility allows for quick finalization of transactions without conflicts, enhancing network throughput and reliability.
* **Conflict Resolution**: In transaction conflicts, the system enables validators to converge towards a consensus decisively, ensuring only non-conflicting transactions are accepted. This process prevents bottlenecks and maintains the integrity and smooth functioning of the network.

### Avalanche Virtual Machine

AWM is likely a feature designed to facilitate communication within the Avalanche ecosystem, possibly enabling secure message passing between wallets or smart contracts. For detailed information, searching for "Avalanche Wallet Messaging" or "AWM Avalanche" on the official Avalanche documentation site or developer forums can yield specific insights into its functionalities, use cases, and integration guides.

### **Avalanche Warp Messaging**

Avalanche Warp Messaging (AWM) allows Virtual Machine (VM) developers to implement arbitrary communication protocols between any two Avalanche Subnets, providing native cross-subnet communication for dApps and developers in the ecosystem. The common use-cases for this configuration include deploying cost-efficient Oracle Networks, execution of token transfers, and state sharding between Subnets.

### **Avalanche Teleporter**

The Avalanche Teleporter is a sophisticated messaging protocol designed to enhance cross-chain communication within the Avalanche ecosystem. Built upon Avalanche Warp Messaging (AWM), Teleporter offers developers a streamlined interface for both sending and receiving messages across different EVM instances, and introduces several advanced features, such as replay protection, retry capabilities for message delivery, relay incentivization, and the specification of allowed relayers, enhancing the reliability and functionality of cross-chain interactions.

1. **Base Layer Consensus Improvements**: Target to cut down the time to finality to below 250 milliseconds, introducing an "optimistic fast finality" mode potentially within one or two rounds. Integrating these upgrades across all APIs will aim to offer users near-instantaneous interactions.
2. **Consensus Capacity Upgrades**: Suggest transitioning the c-chain to a non-primary subnet, necessitating enhanced hardware capabilities. Building on Avalanche's inherent efficiency, this move is expected to boost network and storage capacity significantly.
3. **Deep Code Refactoring**: Plan to substantially reduce technical debt by eliminating most Geth code, retaining only essential state transition logic. This step should minimize Geth dependency, facilitating quicker and safer VM and code updates.
4. **Database Upgrades**: Propose the adoption of FirewoodDB, a linear-access database optimized for blockchain data, after the code overhaul. This should improve the EVM's (and other VMs') read-write efficiency, addressing the substantial processing time currently spent on state data access.
5. **Subnet Upgrades**: To support c-chain-native elastic subnet staking, expanding beyond the current limitation to tokens on the x/p-chains. This capability is crucial given that most active tokens reside on the c-chain, marking a significant advancement for the ecosystem.
6. **AWM and Teleporter Development**: Aim to advance Avalanche Wallet Messaging (AWM) and Teleporter to total production, achieving sub-second time-to-finality for messages between subnets. This would position Avalanche as having the fastest chain-to-chain state transitions in the industry.
7. **HyperSDK Enhancement**: Improve HyperSDK to enable simple modifications and upgrades across chain components, promoting rapid experimentation. This toolkit is envisioned as a comprehensive solution for easy chain component adjustments.
8. **New VMs Introduction**: Advocate for adopting HyperVM, Avalanche's advanced native VM, capable of optimizations beyond the current c-chain's reach, potentially revolutionizing the platform's performance and capabilities.
