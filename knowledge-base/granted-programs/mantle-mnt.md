## ‚åöÔ∏è Background

Mantle Network (Alpha) launched on July 17, 2023, introducing a modular architecture that blends optimistic rollups with state-of-the-art data availability. This architecture is designed to offer lower costs and high throughput while maintaining shared security with the Ethereum Mainnet. The launch follows a six-month test net phase starting January 10, 2023, with over 14 million on-chain transactions, over 140,000 smart contracts deployment, engagement with over 48,000 developers, and connections to upwards of 690,000 unique wallet addresses. The testnet showcased Mantle's stable and efficient modular tech stack and the integration of Mantle DA, its data availability solution powered by EigenDA technology. The network also underwent several security audits, and plans to release the reports and a detailed technology roadmap shortly.

## üó∫Ô∏è Ecosystem <a href="#ecosystem" id="ecosystem"></a>

Mantle Network's platform serves various purposes, including:

üéÆ Gaming: The modular design of Mantle allows for high transaction throughputs and low gas fees, which makes it ideal for gaming DApps. It enables a seamless player experience and has already integrated web3 gaming metaverses like Bullieverse into its ecosystem.

üè¶ DeFi: Mantle aims to make advanced DeFi protocols accessible for widespread adoption, which could potentially drive the creation of innovative financial products and services in the crypto space.

üì± Decentralized Applications (dApps): Mantle supports deploying and operating various dApps and smart contracts in an EVM-compatible developer environment.

## ü™ô Grant Program <a href="#grant-program" id="grant-program"></a>

Mantle Network has introduced the Mantle Grants Program, aiming to support the development and launching of innovative user applications and games. The program prioritizes projects that showcase potential as flagship applications on Mantle Network, particularly those aligned with open-source principles. Granted and Mantle strongly encourages all projects contributing to the ecosystem's growth to share their projects with us, especially those that fit under any categories known to be prioritized by the community.‚Äã

## üß± Tech Stack <a href="#tech-stack" id="tech-stack"></a>

Mantle Network's modular architecture combines an optimistic roll-up protocol with a data availability solution, offering a robust technology stack for scaling Ethereum. During its six-month Testnet phase, the network processed over 14 million transactions and welcomed 48,000+ developers, demonstrating the stability and performance of its tech stack. The main components include the execution layer, Mantle DA for data availability powered by EigenDA technology, and a centralized sequencer with additional modules like the Threshold Signature Scheme for improved off-chain transaction execution results.

**L2 Optimistic Rollup:** This rollup facilitates efficient transaction execution with lower fees and higher speed by assuming transactions are valid by default. This significantly reduces the computational load and allows faster and more cost-effective network operations.

**Fraud Proofs:** Allow any participant or observer of the network to challenge the validity of a transaction or state transition within a 7-day window. This mechanism ensures that even though transactions are assumed to be valid by default for efficiency, there's a safeguard in place to maintain the integrity and security of the network by allowing for these challenges and verifications. Any additional work required is only computed in case of a dispute, significantly improving efficiency and speed. If challenged, a verifier interacts with the challenger to identify and resolve the invalidity. This mechanism ensures that while the system operates optimally under normal conditions, it maintains integrity and security, providing a layer of trust and reliability.

**Data Availability (DA):** Ensure that L1 validators can verify the L2 state, which is vital for the network's security and robustness. Mantle employs **Modular Data Availability** via Mantle DA powered by [EigenLayer's EigenDA](https://www.blog.eigenlayer.xyz/tag/eigenda/) technology, which provides cost-effective and reliable data availability solutions. This approach involves DA economic game theory with rewards and stake-slashing to ensure the necessary data is available for proof construction. This leads to significant cost savings compared to traditional on-chain L1 data availability methods.

**Security:** Mantle Network enhances security by leveraging Ethereum's established protocols, ensuring reliable and secure transaction processing within its efficient Layer 2 environment.

## üõ£Ô∏è Roadmap <a href="#roadmap" id="roadmap"></a>
