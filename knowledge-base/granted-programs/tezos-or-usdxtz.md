# üêè Tezos | $XTZ

### Tezos | $XTZ <a href="#tezos-or-usdxtz" id="tezos-or-usdxtz"></a>

Tezos is a self-amending Liquid Proof of Stake (LPoS) blockchain platform that supports a rich ecosystem of decentralized applications, enabling developers and organizations to create innovative solutions with enhanced security, efficiency, and scalability. Its unique governance model and upgrade protocol foster a community-driven approach to continuous improvement, ensuring that Tezos remains at the forefront of blockchain technology. This adaptability, combined with smart contract capabilities, modular high-throughput L2/roll-up technologies, and a robust developer ecosystem of tools and utilities, positions Tezos as an ideal platform for a wide range of applications, from financial services and gaming to supply chain management and beyond, facilitating a new era of decentralized digital innovation.

### ‚åöÔ∏è Background <a href="#background" id="background"></a>

Development on Tezos began in 2014, with the Tezos Foundation funding research and development from a $232 million ICO in 2017 around the concept of self-amending blockchain, allowing token holders to vote on protocol upgrades. Tezos now operates on a Liquid Proof of Stake model, further enhanced by its formal verification system introduced in 2018. LPoS provides an extra layer of security for smart contracts by mathematically proving their correctness. In 2020, Tezos added privacy features for smart contracts, enabling developers to create applications that can handle sensitive data securely, reinforcing Tezos's position as a leading platform for secure, efficient, and upgradable decentralized applications.&#x20;

### üó∫Ô∏è Ecosystem <a href="#ecosystem" id="ecosystem"></a>

Tezos supports various applications, including Non-fungible tokens (NFTs), Decentralized finance (DeFi), Banking, Decentralized autonomous organizations (DAOs), Decentralized identifiers (DIDs), and Gaming. Check the [Tezos Ecosystem](https://ecosystem.tezos.com/) page for details.

### ü™ô Grant Program <a href="#grant-program" id="grant-program"></a>

The Tezos Foundation has teamed up with Granted, aiming to support the development of innovative user applications and games on the network. The program prioritizes projects that showcase potential as flagship applications on the Tezos Network, particularly those aligned with open-source principles. Granted and Tezos strongly encourages all projects contributing to the growth of the Tezos ecosystem to share their projects with us, especially those that fit under any categories known to be prioritized by the community. ‚Äã

### üß± Tech Stack <a href="#tech-stack" id="tech-stack"></a>

Tezos tech stack includes:

* Liquid Proof of Stake (LPoS) consensus model ([ref](https://tezos.gitlab.io/active/proof\_of\_stake.html)).
* Robust support for standard digital asset types ([ref](https://gitlab.com/tezos/tzip)).
* Forkless, self-amendable smart contracts ([ref](https://tezos.com/whitepaper.pdf)).
* Support for multiple high-level languages (JavaScript/TypeScript, Python, OCaml) ([ref](https://tezos.com/developers/)).
* Formal verification with mathematical proofs to verify the correctness of smart contracts ensures code behaves as intended and significantly reduces the risk of bugs and vulnerabilities ([ref](https://docs.nomadic-labs.com/nomadic-labs-knowledge-center/untitled))
* Michelson, a bespoke, stack-based, low-level programming language crafted for developing smart contracts on the Tezos blockchain, is designed to facilitate this process and make it a more secure platform for developing and deploying smart contracts ([ref](https://www.michelson.org/)).
* Smart Rollup solutions enable blazing speeds of up to 1 million TPS ([ref](https://tezos.com/developers/smart-rollups/)).
* Etherlink is an EVM-compatible, fully decentralized optimistic rollup offering sub $0.01 transaction prices ([ref](https://www.etherlink.com/)).
* Data Availability Committee (DAC): A unique Data Availability solution for scaling the transaction throughput of  [Smart Rollups](https://tezos.gitlab.io/alpha/smart\_rollups.html) ([ref](https://research-development.nomadic-labs.com/introducing-data-availability-committees.html)).&#x20;

### üõ£Ô∏è Roadmap <a href="#roadmap" id="roadmap"></a>

The recent developments in Tezos's roadmap emphasize a commitment to scalability and interoperability, with a focus on the following:

* **Performance Enhancement:** Aiming for high throughput, low latency, and lower fees.
* **Composability:** Simplifying asset and information transfer between protocols.
* **Decentralization:** Ensuring network stability and distributed control.
* **Interoperability:** Smooth integration of various systems and languages.
* **Improved Developer Experience:** Providing a user-friendly environment for builders.

The Ultra High Throughput (UHT) rollup is a major feature that will make Tezos lighter and more efficient, decreasing latency and simplifying consensus processes. This is part of a broader strategy to increase transaction speed and efficiency, indicating a significant evolution in Tezos's capabilities and a move towards a more advanced blockchain ecosystem ([ref](https://spotlight.tezos.com/generation-next-a-sneak-peek-into-tezos-ultra-high-throughput-future/)).
