### **Non-fungible Token (NFT)**

NFTs are unique digital assets on the blockchain that represent ownership or proof of authenticity of a specific item or piece of content, such as art, music, or videos. Unlike cryptocurrencies, NFTs cannot be exchanged on a one-to-one basis with other tokens because each NFT has a distinct value.

### **ERC-721 NFTs**

ERC-721 is a standard for NFTs on the Ethereum blockchain. Each ERC-721 token is unique and cannot be exchanged on a one-to-one basis with other tokens. These NFTs are often used to represent ownership of digital or physical assets, such as artwork, collectibles, virtual real estate, and more.

### **ERC-1155 NFTs**

ERC-1155 is another standard for NFTs on the Ethereum blockchain, designed to be more flexible than ERC-721. ERC-1155 tokens can represent both fungible and non-fungible assets within a single contract. A single ERC-1155 contract can handle multiple NFTs, offering developers greater efficiency and versatility.

**Key Differences:**

* **Uniqueness vs. Multi-Fungibility:** ERC-721 tokens are unique and non-fungible, meaning each token has distinct properties or attributes. ERC-1155 tokens can be non-fungible and fungible within the same contract, allowing developers to create various token types in a single deployment.
* &#x20;**Efficiency and Gas Costs:** ERC-1155 is often considered more gas-efficient than ERC-721, as it allows for managing multiple token types in a single contract. This can result in cost savings for developers and users when interacting with these tokens on the Ethereum blockchain.
* **Due to their standardization and popularity, the Interoperability ERC-721 tokens are widely supported by NFT marketplaces, wallets, and applications**. While ERC-1155 tokens offer more flexibility in creating custom token types, adoption may vary across platforms.

**Metadata and Attributes:** Both ERC-721 and ERC-1155 tokens can include metadata and attributes to provide additional information about the assets they represent. This information is often used for display and interaction purposes in NFT applications.

**Smart Contract Complexity:** ERC-721 contracts tend to be simpler, as they deal with individual unique tokens. ERC-1155 contracts can be more complex due to handling multiple token types, but they offer a single contract solution for managing diverse assets.

**Batch Operations:** ERC-1155 allows batch operations, which makes it more efficient for performing actions on multiple tokens at once. This can be especially useful in gaming scenarios.

### **ERC-998 Composable NFTs**

ERC-998 is an extension of ERC-721 that enables the creation of composable NFTs. These NFTs can hold other NFTs or fungible tokens, creating nested ownership structures. It's often used for complex in-game items and assets in blockchain-based games.

### **ERC-20 and NFT Bridges**

Some projects have developed bridges or standards to convert ERC-20 tokens (fungible tokens) into NFTs and vice versa. This innovation allows for unique fungible tokens or fractional ownership of NFTs.

### **Fractional Ownership**

Fractional ownership is achieved by dividing an NFT into smaller, tradable units, often as fungible blockchain tokens. These fungible tokens, sometimes called "NFT shares" or "NFT fractions," can be bought, sold, and traded like regular tokens.&#x20;

**Benefits of Fractional Ownership:**

* **Access to High-Value NFTs:** Fractional ownership democratizes access to high-value NFTs that may be out of reach for individual buyers. Investors can pool their resources to own prestigious NFTs collectively.
* **Liquidity and Trading:** Fractional ownership tokens can be freely traded on secondary markets, providing liquidity to NFT investors. This allows token holders to exit their investments or trade their shares easily.
* **Collective Decision-Making:** Token holders often participate in governance decisions regarding the NFT. This can include voting whether to sell the NFT, display it in a virtual gallery, or use it in a decentralized application (dApp).
* **Reduced Risk:** Fractional ownership can mitigate the risk of investing in a single NFT. If the NFT's value fluctuates, the impact on each token holder is proportionate to their ownership share.

**Use Cases and Applications:**

* **Art Ownership:** Fractional ownership allows multiple art enthusiasts to collectively own valuable digital artworks, granting them the right to display the artwork in their virtual galleries or sell their shares.
* **Real Estate and Virtual Land:** In virtual worlds and metaverse platforms, fractional ownership can apply to virtual real estate or land parcels, enabling shared ownership of virtual properties.
* **Music Royalties:** Musicians and creators can tokenize ownership of their music rights and distribute them among investors, allowing for shared revenue from music sales and royalties.
* **Collectibles and Rare Items:** High-value collectibles and rare in-game items can be fractionalized, making them more accessible to a broader audience of collectors and gamers.

It's important to note that the implementation of fractional ownership may vary depending on the blockchain platform and the specific smart contract used. Additionally, regulatory considerations may apply, so participants should be aware of legal requirements and tax implications related to fractional ownership of NFTs in their respective jurisdictions.

### Stateful NFTs

Stateful NFTs, also known as "Smart NFTs" or "Interactive NFTs," are a type of non-fungible token (NFT) that goes beyond static digital assets. Unlike traditional NFTs, which primarily represent ownership of a unique item or piece of content, stateful NFTs can change, adapt, or respond to various inputs, conditions, or interactions. Here are key characteristics and examples of stateful NFTs:

**Characteristics of Stateful NFTs:**

1. **Programmability:** Stateful NFTs are programmable and contain embedded code or smart contracts that enable them to perform specific actions or respond to triggers.
2. **Interactivity:** These NFTs can interact with external data sources, user inputs, or other smart contracts, allowing them to change their behavior or appearance in real-time.
3. **Dynamic Attributes:** Stateful NFTs can have dynamic attributes or properties that can be modified or updated over time. These attributes can affect the NFT's appearance, functionality, or value.
4. **Utility and Functionality:** Stateful NFTs often have utility or functionality beyond simple ownership. They can represent access rights, memberships, or in-game items in decentralized applications (dApps) or virtual worlds.

**Examples of Stateful NFTs:**

1. **Virtual Pets:** Stateful NFTs can represent virtual pets or creatures that require care and interaction. Owners may need to feed, play with, or train their virtual pets to make them grow or gain new abilities.
2. **In-Game Items:** In blockchain-based games, stateful NFTs can be in-game items with attributes, abilities, and durability. For example, a sword NFT could level up and become more powerful through use in the game.
3. **Art and Music NFTs:** Interactive art or music NFTs can change their appearance or play different compositions based on external factors like time of day, weather conditions, or user interactions.
4. **Collectible Cards:** Stateful NFTs can represent collectible cards that evolve or gain new abilities over time, creating dynamic gameplay experiences in blockchain card games.
5. **Virtual Real Estate:** Virtual land NFTs can have stateful features, such as building structures or generating resources over time. Owners can develop their virtual properties within decentralized metaverse platforms.
6. **Membership and Access Tokens:** Stateful NFTs can serve as membership or access tokens to exclusive communities, events, or content. Ownership of these NFTs grants privileges and access to specific areas or features within a platform or ecosystem.
7. **Dynamic Art and Stories:** Interactive artworks or narratives can change based on user interactions or external data, offering unique storytelling experiences through NFTs.
8. **Utility Tokens:** Some NFTs act as utility tokens within dApps or platforms, enabling specific actions or functions, such as voting, governance participation, or resource allocation.

### Soulbound Tokens (SBT)

Soulbound Tokens (SBTs), introduced by Ethereum's Vitalik Buterin and others, are non-transferable tokens representing personal identities, credentials, and affiliations in a decentralized society (DeSoc). Unsellable and non-financialized, they aim to enhance trust and governance in Web3, with applications in DAOs, KYC, credit scoring, and combating online bots. Like the metaverse, SBTs are pivotal in blending physical and virtual realities by symbolizing human interactions. However, they face challenges like wallet recovery, potential misuse as a social credit system, and ethical issues in reputation-based societies. As a developing concept, SBTs hold promise for shaping the future of Web3 and decentralized communities, balancing technological innovation with social identity and community dynamics. SBTs can be used to represent and verify personal credentials, achievements, and affiliations, enhancing trust and collaboration in digital communities; they are applicable in DAO governance, allowing for delegated authority based on verified attributes, can be instrumental in KYC processes, credit scoring systems, and combating bots and spam in online environments, and more!

### **NFT Drops**

Exclusive Non-Fungible Token (NFT) assets are distributed to users/players as rewards.

### **NFT Marketplaces**

Integration with NFT marketplaces like OpenSea or Rarible for trading on-chain assets.

## NFT Use-Cases

### Trial/Ephemeral NFTs

Ephemeral or Trial Utility NFTs are a novel concept in the NFT space that allows for temporary access to digital content through NFTs. These NFTs are particularly suited for Free-to-Play games and adopt a 'Try before Buy' approach. Unlike traditional NFTs, Ephemeral NFTs come with an expiration date or limited use, introducing a dynamic aspect to digital ownership. This model enables unique time-bound experiences within the NFT ecosystem, enhances user engagement through limited-time access, and facilitates financial inclusion by allowing users to experience premium features without a complete purchase. Ephemeral NFTs can be applied in various fields, such as gaming, art, and culture, and are seen as a way to introduce scarcity and increase the perceived value of digital assets. See [ERC-7066](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-7066), which pertains to creating and handling NFTs with disposable attributes, enabling access for a limited time or under specific usage conditions. This concept is particularly relevant in contexts where NFTs are used temporarily, such as in gaming, art, and culture, where they provide time-bound access to content or experiencesâ€‹â€‹.

### NFT Rentals

NFT Rentals allow individuals to access NFTs for a limited period without full ownership, using smart contracts as escrow. This method benefits both NFT owners, who can earn passive income by lending their NFTs, and renters, who can enjoy NFTs' privileges without the high ownership cost. There are two forms of NFT renting: collateral renting, where renters pay a fee and deposit collateral, and collateral-less renting, which does not require a deposit from the renter.

### P2P Loans

In the context of NFTs, Peer-to-Peer (P2P) loans allow NFT owners to use their digital assets as collateral for loans. This approach helps owners unlock liquidity from their NFT holdings without selling them. These loans typically involve creating a smart contract where the NFT is held as collateral until the loan is repaid. The specific terms, such as interest rates and repayment period, are agreed upon between the borrower and the lender. This system provides a unique opportunity for NFT owners to leverage the value of their digital assets while retaining ownership.

### Primary Sales Mint

"Primary Sales Mint" is often associated with NFTs' initial creation and sale. This process involves minting, creating, and recording a digital asset on the blockchain, making it an NFT. In primary sales, creators or project developers directly sell these NFTs to buyers. The minting process is crucial as it transforms a digital file into a unique, verifiable asset on the blockchain. Primary sales are significant for creators as they represent the first opportunity to monetize their digital artworks or assets directly to a community or the public.

### NFT Mandate

An NFT Mandate refers to mechanisms that commit to transferring NFTs at a later date, contingent on specific conditions or events. This concept is akin to a futures contract in traditional finance, where the ownership and transfer of an NFT are predetermined by a set of agreed-upon criteria in the future. These mandates are enforced through smart contracts, ensuring that the transfer of the NFT is executed automatically once the conditions are met. This method is beneficial when NFTs are used for event tickets, memberships, or other time-bound utilities.

### Post-Mint Utility

In NFTs, post-mint utility pertains to the added value and benefits introduced to an NFT collection after the initial minting process. This could include access to exclusive content, membership privileges, additional digital assets, or participation in community events. Enhancing NFTs with post-mint utility is a strategy.
