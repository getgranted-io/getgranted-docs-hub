P2E is a game mechanic where players can earn cryptocurrency or digital assets by actively participating in a game. This can include completing quests, winning battles, or achieving in-game objectives that result in tangible rewards. Players are incentivized to spend time and effort within the game to accumulate valuable assets.

### **P2O (Play to Own)**

P2O is a game mechanic that allows players to own in-game assets as actual digital property. These assets are typically represented as NFTs on the blockchain, providing players with full ownership rights. Players can freely buy, sell, and trade these assets, creating a player-driven virtual economy.

### **S2E (Swag to Earn)**&#x20;

Swag-to-Earn incentivizes players to earn from swagging. Players gain revenue from flaunting, showing off assets, attending fashion events, socializing with other players, and participating in virtual communities' entertainment activities. The metrics considered are the Social Index, Fashion Index, and Entertainment Index.

### **K2E (Kill-to-Earn)**

K2E is a game mechanic implemented in Battle Royale games where players are rewarded with cryptocurrency, digital assets, or in-game currency for eliminating other players (killing opponents) within the game. It introduces a competitive and lucrative element to traditional Battle Royale gameplay.

### **PEC (Play-Earn-Conserve)**

PEC is a model where players can engage with network-based games or web3 applications to earn economic incentives while actively contributing to nature conservation efforts. It combines gaming, blockchain, and environmental sustainability to create a rewarding and environmentally responsible gaming experience.

The Phygital Metaverse is a fusion of the physical and digital worlds, where augmented reality (AR), virtual reality (VR), and blockchain technologies combine to create a seamless, immersive, and interconnected environment. It blurs physical and virtual reality boundaries, enabling users to interact with digital and real-world elements in a shared, persistent space. In the Phygital Metaverse, spatially-driven experiences, events, and exhibitions where users can simultaneously participate, explore, and engage with digital and physical elements are possible like never before.

### **Digital Twins**&#x20;

Digital twins are digital representations or avatars of physical objects, spaces, or individuals. They enable synchronization between the physical and digital realms within the metaverse.
