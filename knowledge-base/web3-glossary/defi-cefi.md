# üçÑ DeFi/CeFi

### Airdrop

An Airdrop is a method used in cryptocurrency to distribute tokens directly to users' wallets, often for free. This strategy typically engages a broader user base, rewards existing members, or grants them governance voting rights within a network or project.

### Anti-money Laundering (AML)

Anti-money Laundering (AML) refers to the practices, policies, and regulations centralized entities implement to comply with local and federal laws to detect, report, and prevent illegal financial activities. These measures are crucial for mitigating the risks associated with money laundering and terrorism financing.

### Automated Market Maker (AMM)

An Automated Market Maker (AMM) is a decentralized platform that allows users to trade cryptocurrencies through a liquidity pool without the need for traditional market makers. Uniswap is a prominent example of an AMM.

### Collateral

In DeFi, collateral involves offering one cryptocurrency or token to secure a loan of a different cryptocurrency or token.

### CeFi

CeFi, short for Centralized Finance, refers to traditional finance methods and markets. It includes centralized cryptocurrency exchanges, businesses, or organizations with a physical presence and often a corporate structure similar to conventional financial entities like banks and investment firms. CeFi entities are typically regulated and must comply with the laws and regulations of their operating jurisdictions.

### CEX

Related to CeFi is CEX, or Centralized Exchange, which has a physical address and a corporate structure and is subject to applicable laws, codes of practice, and regulations of the jurisdictions in which it operates.

### **Decentralized Exchange (DEX)**

A DEX, or Distributed Exchange, in the context of DeFi, is a cryptocurrency exchange that facilitates direct peer-to-peer transactions securely online without requiring an intermediary.

### **DEX/Cex Aggregator**

A DEX/CEX Aggregator protocol pools liquidity from various (de)centralized exchanges to offer users better trading conditions, such as lower slippage, reduced swap fees, and more competitive token prices through a single interface.

### **Derivative**

In the context of DeFi, a derivative is a financial instrument based on the value of another asset or group of assets. This can include synthetic assets, futures, options, and prediction markets.

### Fiat Money

Fiat money is a currency issued by governments. Physical commodities like gold or silver do not back it but by the issuing government's authority. Unlike most cryptocurrencies, it is recognized as legal tender within its jurisdiction.

### Flash Loan

A Flash Loan is a unique cryptocurrency concept that allows borrowers to take out a loan without collateral, provided the loan is repaid within the same transaction block. If the loan is not repaid in that transaction, it is as if it never happened. This mechanism is used for arbitrage, collateral swapping, or other decentralized finance (DeFi) strategies.

### Impermanent Loss

Impermanent Loss occurs in Automated Market Makers (AMMs) when liquidity providers (LPs) contribute assets to a liquidity pool but may withdraw a different value than initially contributed. This is due to asset price changes in the pool, leading to a potential loss compared to simply holding the assets. The loss is termed "impermanent" because it can be reversed if asset prices return to their original levels at withdrawal time.

### Liquidity

Liquidity refers to the ease with which an asset can be converted into cash or another asset without significantly affecting its price. In the context of exchanges, economies, or networks, it measures the available circulating supply and the level of trading activity. An asset or currency is considered illiquid if it has a low supply and limited trading activity, making it harder to buy or sell without impacting its price.

### Liquidity Mining

Liquidity Mining is a process in the cryptocurrency world where participants, known as liquidity providers, supply capital to liquidity pools on decentralized exchanges or other DeFi platforms. In return for their contribution, they earn rewards, typically from the platform's native tokens. This mechanism is designed to incentivize the provision of liquidity, facilitating trading and other transactions on the blockchain while supporting and expanding the platform's user base.

### Liquidity Pool

A Liquidity Pool (LP) is a collection of funds locked in a smart contract that provides liquidity to a specific currency, network, or other types of decentralized finance (DeFi) applications. Contributors to these pools, known as liquidity providers, deposit their assets into the pool to facilitate trading and other transactions. In return for their contribution, they often receive rewards or incentives, a process closely related to liquidity mining, where participants earn rewards for providing liquidity to these pools.

### **Limit Order**

An order to buy or sell a cryptocurrency at a specific price or better. It ensures the trader will not pay more or receive less than this specified price.

### **Liquidity**&#x20;

Liquidity refers to how easily assets can be bought or sold in the market without significantly affecting their price. High liquidity indicates a stable market where assets can be quickly converted to cash.

### **Liquidity Pool**

A collection of funds locked in a smart contract that facilitates trading by providing liquidity on decentralized exchanges. Liquidity providers who contribute to these pools earn fees from trades executed within the pool, incentivizing liquidity provision.

### **Liquidity Provider (LP)**

An individual or entity that deposits two tokens of equal value into a liquidity pool to facilitate trading on a decentralized exchange (DEX), earning a portion of the trading fees as compensation.

### **Liquidity Source**

Any platform or mechanism that provides liquidity for trading operations, including decentralized exchanges (DEXs), centralized exchanges (CEXs), financial institutions, and private market makers.

### **LP Tokens**

Tokens are issued to liquidity providers as evidence of their contribution to a liquidity pool. These tokens can be used to reclaim the contributed liquidity, plus any earned fees, and may also qualify for additional rewards in liquidity mining programs.

### **Market Order**

A type of order to buy or sell a token immediately at the best available current price.

### **Maximal Extractable Value (MEV)**

**Maximal Extractable Value (MEV) is t**he practice of validators or miners on a blockchain rearranging, adding, or excluding transactions within a block to maximize their profits from the transactions processed.

### Mining Pool

A Mining Pool is a collective group of cryptocurrency miners who combine their computational resources over a network to strengthen the chances of successfully mining a cryptocurrency. By pooling their efforts, they increase their collective hashing power, making it more likely to mine blocks and receive rewards. These rewards are distributed among the pool participants based on each contributed's computational power. Mining Pool operators and contributors are motivated by the mining rewards programmed into a coin's protocol, which incentivize them to support transactions and enhance liquidity on the coin's network.

### **Over the Counter (OTC)**

This is a method of trading that occurs directly between parties without using a centralized exchange. It is often used for large trades to minimize market impact.

### **Price Slippage**

Price Slippage is the difference between the expected price of a trade and the price at which the trade is executed. Depending on market movements between when an order is placed and filled, slippage can be positive or negative.

### Slippage

Slippage in crypto trading is the difference between the expected price of a trade and the price at which the trade is executed. It can result in a final sale price higher or lower than anticipated.

### Stablecoins

Stablecoins are cryptocurrencies designed to maintain a stable value by being pegged to assets like the US Dollar, gold, or a basket of cryptocurrencies. This pegging mechanism aims to combine the benefits of digital currency with the stability of traditional assets.

### Staking

Staking involves depositing cryptocurrency coins or tokens into a yield farming project or protocol, accessible via either Centralized Finance (CeFi) or Decentralized Finance (DeFi) methods, to earn rewards or interest.

### **Swap**

The process of exchanging one cryptocurrency for another at a predetermined rate.

### **Swap Fee**

A fee is incurred for each swap transaction, the amount of which is determined and distributed by the 1inch Network's governance stakeholders.

### Total Value Locked (TVL)

The Total Value Locked (TVL), or Total Locked Value (TLV), represents the total dollar value of all cryptocurrencies deposited and locked into a platform, protocol, lending program, yield farming initiative, or insurance liquidity pool. It's a key metric used to assess the size and health of DeFi projects.

### Testnet

A Testnet is a separate blockchain for testing new coins, projects, products, or potential improvements to existing offerings. It allows developers and users to experiment with transactions, staking, trading, and other activities without risking real assets, serving as a safe environment for testing and learning.

### Wallet

A Wallet in the context of cryptocurrency is either a software application or a hardware device designed to store, send, and receive various types of cryptocurrencies. It secures the user's private keys, which are necessary to access and manage their digital assets.

### **Whitelisted Token**

This token has been thoroughly reviewed and approved by the 1inch Foundation for trading. Trading non-whitelisted, or "custom," tokens is considered riskier.

### **Yield Farming**

Users can stake their on-chain assets, such as tokens or in-game assets (NFTs), to earn additional rewards.
