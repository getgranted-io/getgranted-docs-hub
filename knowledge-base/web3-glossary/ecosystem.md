# ☘️ Ecosystem

### Block Explorers

A Block Explorer is an online tool that allows users to search and explore all publicly available information on a blockchain, including transactions, blocks, addresses, and other relevant data.

### **Bridge**

A bridge is a decentralized protocol that enables the transfer of tokens between blockchains, allowing for network interoperability. It facilitates the conversion of tokens with the same contract addresses across various blockchains.

### **Decentralized Application (dApp)**

A dApp is a software application that operates on a distributed network, utilizing blockchain technology and smart contracts to enable user interactions without centralized control.

### Oracle

An Oracle in the context of blockchain and decentralized applications (dApps) is a system that provides external data to smart contracts on the blockchain. It bridges the blockchain and the real world, ensuring the data is timely, accurate, and secure. Oracles are crucial for enabling smart contracts to execute based on real-world events and conditions, such as market prices, weather conditions, or any other external data points necessary for the contract's logic.

## Wallets

### **Cold Wallet**

Also known as cold storage, a cold wallet is a cryptocurrency wallet that is kept offline for enhanced security. It can be a hardware device (like Ledger or Trezor), a paper wallet, or even memorized private keys or recovery phrases, protecting against online hacking risks.

### Multisig Wallet

A Multisig Wallet is a cryptocurrency wallet that requires multiple signatures to authorize a transaction. This feature enhances security by distributing control over the wallet's funds or changes to smart contracts among several parties. In community-governed projects, such as DAOs, a multi-sig wallet ensures that no single individual can execute transactions unilaterally, requiring approval from multiple authorized signers before any transaction. This mechanism is handy for managing collective funds or making decisions in a decentralized manner.
