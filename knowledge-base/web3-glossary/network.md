## Blockchain Networks

### **Layer 0 (L0)**

Layer 0 (L0) blockchains serve as the foundational infrastructure in the blockchain architecture,  providing the necessary infrastructure for launching multiple Layer 1 networks, each tailored for specific tasks and addressing scalability challenges, enabling Layer 1 networks to communicate and interact seamlessly. Layer 0 architecture typically includes a main chain that stores transaction data from various Layer 1 chains and independent Layer 1 networks known as sidechains, which run their consensus mechanisms but may share the security features of the main chain and allow for secure and efficient data and token transfers between different blockchains in the Layer 0 ecosystem.

### **Layer 1 (L1)**

Layer 1 (L1) blockchains are the foundational networks in the blockchain ecosystem, responsible for processing and validating transactions, maintaining consensus, and supporting smart contracts and decentralized applications (dApps). These standalone networks face scalability challenges, which they address through various innovations such as sharding and consensus mechanism upgrades. Examples include Ethereum, SKALE, and Tezos, each offering unique capabilities that underpin multiple applications, from financial services to digital collectibles. As the core of decentralized technology, L1 blockchains are essential for ensuring transaction integrity, security, and the decentralized nature of the blockchain, serving as the backbone for a growing digital economy and the development of higher-layer solutions.

### **Layer 2 (L2)**&#x20;

Layer 2 solutions are built on top of Layer 1 blockchains and are designed to enhance scalability and efficiency. They achieve this by handling a portion of the transactional workload off the main chain, thereby reducing congestion. L2 solutions include rollups, state channels, and nested blockchains. Rollups bundle multiple transactions and validate them before submitting them to the main chain as a single transaction. State channels allow two-way communication for transactions off the main chain. Nested blockchains involve secondary chains working under the main chain's rules, handling day-to-day transactions, and reporting to the main chain only for finalization or dispute resolution. Examples of Layer 2 solutions are the Bitcoin Lightning Network, Ethereum's Raiden, and platforms like Optimism and Arbitrum, which use rollup technology‚Äã‚Äã‚Äã‚Äã.

### **Layer 3 (L3)**

Layer 3 focuses on interoperability between different blockchain networks and is designed to enhance the scalability of blockchain networks beyond the capabilities of L1 and L2. It offers an infrastructure for developing more complex decentralized applications (dApps) that require advanced features and functionalities.

### **Layer 4 (L4)**

Layer 4 is where most decentralized applications (dApps) run, using smart contracts to execute their business logic‚Äã. In the blockchain architecture, it is often called the application or user interface layer. It represents the entry point for users into the blockchain ecosystem, providing user-friendly interfaces and interactions with the underlying blockchain technology.

### **Sidechains**

Sidechains are independent blockchain networks that link to a parent blockchain (like Bitcoin or Ethereum) through a two-way peg. They have consensus protocols and can operate independently, improving privacy and security. The critical feature of sidechains is their ability to facilitate the transfer of digital assets between the mainnet and the sidechain, allowing users to move assets across networks seamlessly. They essentially expand the capabilities of the leading blockchain by allowing more experimental or niche applications without overburdening the leading network‚Äã‚Äãwhile still being linked to the network's ecosystem and security.

## Blockchain Concepts

### Composability

Composability in DeFi or crypto refers to a product's ability to easily integrate and function with other products, enabling the creation of complex systems. High composability indicates a protocol is simple, powerful, and interoperable with different protocols.

### **Block Reward**

This is the reward given to miners or validators for verifying and securing transactions in a new block on a blockchain. Block rewards, consisting of newly minted coins or tokens, incentivize participants in the network's consensus mechanism.

### **Consensus**

In blockchain, consensus is the process by which all nodes in the network agree on the validity and order of transactions within a block. This agreement is crucial for maintaining the integrity and security of the blockchain.

### **Custom Token**

Refers to any token based on standard protocols like ERC20 (Ethereum), BEP20 (Binance Smart Chain), or MRC20 that haven't been officially listed or supported by specific platforms or services, such as the 1inch Network. Custom tokens can be created by any entity or individual for various purposes within the blockchain ecosystem.

### Gas Fees

Gas fees are payments made to Ethereum miners to process and validate transactions on the Ethereum blockchain. For example, for Ethereum's the native token is used, ETH, and are typically calculated in small units known as Gwei.

### **Public Address**

A unique identifier, typically 42 characters long, is used to receive funds in a cryptocurrency wallet. It can be shared publicly and is often available in QR code format for ease of use.

### **Stablecoin**

To mitigate volatility, a cryptocurrency is designed to maintain a stable value relative to a specific asset, such as a fiat currency.

### **Synthetic Token**

A derivative token that derives its value from an underlying asset without requiring direct ownership.

### **Off-Chain**

Refers to activities or transactions that occur outside the blockchain network. These processes are not recorded on the blockchain and often involve external systems or databases.

### **On-Chain**

This term pertains to activities or transactions directly on the blockchain, making them transparent and verifiable through a block explorer.

### **Private Key**

A secure alphanumeric code that grants access to a cryptocurrency wallet. It is essential for authorizing transactions and accessing funds stored in the wallet. For security reasons, it is crucial to keep the private key confidential and never share it with anyone.\


## Governance

### **Governance Staking**

This is a mechanism where community members lock up their tokens, such as 1-inch tokens, to gain voting rights on protocol decisions. Unlike other forms of staking, 1inch Network does not provide rewards for governance staking.

### **Governance Token**

A type of token that grants holders the right to vote on a blockchain protocol's future direction and decisions. These tokens are primarily used for voting and do not typically offer other utilities.

### DAO

A DAO, or Distributed Autonomous Organization, is an organization represented by rules encoded as a computer program on a blockchain. It operates transparently, is controlled by its members, and is independent of central governance.

### **Tokenomics**

The study of the economics surrounding a cryptocurrency includes aspects like supply, distribution, and various mechanisms affecting its price and utilization.

### **Internal Commission**

A fee mechanism is built into some tokens that deduct a portion of the token during transactions. This commission can be allocated for burning, funding development, or distribution to token holders.
