## ü™à The Granted. Story

Granted is more than a grant application platform; we're the driving force behind blockchain innovation. Our extensive network of grant foundations provides crucial funding access to expedite transformative projects.

Our approach focuses on efficiency and innovation. We streamline the application process for candidates, ensuring they receive due attention and manage grant milestones to keep projects on track. At Granted, we believe in empowering every groundbreaking idea with the opportunity to secure funding, accelerating the journey from concept to reality.

### üó∫Ô∏è What we do

Granted is a fully managed service. Our team takes pride in building personal relationships not just with grant committees, but also with our clients. We feel that by taking this personal approach and understanding clearly our client's vision and the needs of the Foundations, we can become a driven force in accelerating Web3 adoption.

Granted partners with grant foundations to get a clear understanding of the criteria projects must meet to receive grant funding. With this information we are able to pre-evaluate our clients on behalf of the network and subsequently create and submit applications that are in line with the committee's requirements for prompt consideration.

Granted manages the entire application process, from creating the application framework to submitting the application directly to the foundation. We also build and oversee our clients project milestones, making sure they get all the assistance they require to effectively complete each milestone and produce the best possible version of their project.

### üìç The Fundraising Nexus Dashboard

At Granted, we understand the importance of a streamlined fundraising journey. That's why we've developed the Fundraising Nexus Dashboard, a central hub designed to simplify and enhance the grant application process for both our clients and grant foundations.

**Features of the Fundraising Nexus Dashboard:**

1. **User-Friendly Interface**: The Nexus Dashboard is intuitively designed to be user-friendly, ensuring ease of navigation for all users, regardless of their technical expertise.
2. **Centralized Application Tracking**: It offers a unified platform where clients can monitor the progress of their applications at every stage, from initial submission to final decision.
3. **Direct Communication Channels**: The platform facilitates direct and efficient communication between clients and grant foundations, allowing for the seamless exchange of documents and information.
4. **Milestone Management**: Clients can set, manage, and track the milestones of their projects, ensuring they stay on schedule and meet their objectives.
5. **Comprehensive Documentation Access**: The Nexus provides a centralized repository for all necessary documentation, making it easy for clients to access and manage their paperwork.
6. **Affiliate Area with Preferential Rates**: A unique feature of the Nexus is the affiliate area, which grants clients access to a network of blockchain service providers, offering preferential rates and specialized services tailored to the needs of blockchain projects.
7. **Ongoing Support and Guidance**: The Granted team is always available to assist clients with any queries or guidance they need while using the Nexus Dashboard, ensuring a smooth onboarding and usage experience.

The Fundraising Nexus Dashboard is more than just a tool; it's a comprehensive solution designed to make the grant application process as efficient and stress-free as possible. By centralizing key functions and providing essential resources in one accessible platform, the Nexus Dashboard stands as a testament to Granted's commitment to facilitating success in the blockchain space.

### üìú **GetGranted Preferred Access Policy**

The GetGranted Preferred Access Policy is a cornerstone of Granted's approach to facilitating successful grant applications. This policy is built on strategic partnerships with various grant committees, enabling the Granted team to gain deep insights into the specific requirements and preferences of these foundations. Here‚Äôs how this policy enhances the grant application process:

1. **Strategic Partnerships with Grant Committees**: By partnering directly with grant committees, Granted gains a thorough understanding of what these committees are looking for in potential projects. This knowledge enables us to guide our clients effectively in aligning their initiatives with these preferences.
2. **Tailored Application Preparation**: Our team assists clients in preparing and proposing new grants, ensuring that each application is crafted to meet the specific criteria and expectations of the target foundation.
3. **Pre-Qualification of Clients**: We employ a rigorous pre-qualification process for our clients, ensuring that they meet the high standards expected by grant foundations. This process includes an in-depth review of their projects, objectives, and capabilities.
4. **Prioritized Application Processing**: Due to our established relationships and the trust we've built with grant committees, applications submitted through Granted often receive priority consideration. Grant foundations recognize that our pre-vetted applications are likely to meet their criteria, leading to a more efficient review process.
5. **Continuous Collaboration and Feedback Loop**: Our ongoing collaboration with grant committees also means we receive continuous feedback, allowing us to refine our approach and provide our clients with up-to-date advice on how to improve their grant applications.
6. **Enhanced Success Rates**: As a result of these concerted efforts, our clients benefit from a higher likelihood of their applications being accepted, thanks to the alignment with grant committee expectations and the prioritization of their submissions.
