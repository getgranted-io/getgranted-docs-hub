# ðŸ”– Glossary

**Client-side Development:** Focuses on creating user-facing applications and interfaces that interact with blockchain technology for an improved user experience.

**Smart Contracts:** Involves creating self-executing contracts with the terms directly written into code, enabling trustless and automated agreements on the blockchain.

**Protocol Development:** Centers on developing and enhancing the underlying protocols and algorithms that form the backbone of blockchain networks, ensuring security, efficiency, and scalability.

**Development Networks & Node Management:** Concerns the creation and maintenance of networks and nodes that support the blockchain infrastructure, ensuring robustness and reliability.

**Tooling:** Involves developing tools and utilities that aid developers in building, testing, and deploying blockchain applications more efficiently.

**Cryptographic Research and Development:** Focuses on advancing the security and efficiency of blockchain systems through innovative cryptographic techniques, including encryption, consensus algorithms, and privacy-preserving technologies.

## Blockchain

**Sidechain:** A sidechain is an independent blockchain that operates separately from the Network, such as Ethereum Mainnet, yet remains connected to it through a two-way bridge. Distinct from layer 2 scaling solutions, sidechains maintain their independence by not sending state changes and transaction data back to the Mainnet. This structure allows sidechains to function autonomously while still being linked to the network's ecosystem.

**Yield Farming**: Users can stake their on-chain assets such as tokens or in-game assets (NFTs) to earn additional rewards.

**NFT Drops**: Exclusive Non-Fungible Token (NFT) assets that are distributed to users/players as rewards.

**NFT Marketplaces**: Integration with NFT marketplaces like OpenSea or Rarible for trading on-chain assets.

**Decentralized Autonomous Organizations (DAOs)**: Users collectively govern network / application roadmap decisions and management assets through community governance.

## Gaming

**P2E / Play to Earn:** P2E is a game mechanic where players can earn cryptocurrency or digital assets by actively participating in a game. This can include completing quests, winning battles, or achieving in-game objectives that result in tangible rewards. Players are incentivized to spend time and effort within the game to accumulate valuable assets.

**P2O (Play to Own):** P2O is a game mechanic that allows players to own in-game assets as true digital property. These assets are typically represented as NFTs on the blockchain, providing players with full ownership rights. Players can buy, sell, and trade these assets freely, creating a player-driven virtual economy.

**S2E (Swag to Earn):** Swag-to-Earn incentivizes players to earn from swagging. Players gain revenue from flaunting, showing off assets, attending fashion events, socializing with other players and involving in entertainment activities in virtual communities. Metrics considered are as such: Social Index, Fashion Index and Entertainment Index.

**PEC / Play-Earn-Conserve:** PEC is a model where players can engage with network-based games or other web3 applications to earn economic incentives while actively contributing to nature conservation efforts. It combines gaming, blockchain, and environmental sustainability to create a rewarding and environmentally responsible gaming experience.

**Related Topics**

**Environmental Tokenomics:** PEC employs tokenomics that reward players with cryptocurrency or digital assets as they engage with eco-conscious games and applications. These incentives motivate users to participate and contribute to nature conservation initiatives.

**Proof of Conservation (PoC):** PoC is a consensus mechanism that verifies and rewards players for their contributions to environmental conservation. It may involve actions such as planting trees, reducing carbon footprint, or supporting eco-friendly projects.

**Phygital Metaverse:** The Phygital Metaverse is a fusion of the physical and digital worlds, where augmented reality (AR), virtual reality (VR), and blockchain technologies combine to create a seamless, immersive, and interconnected environment. It blurs the boundaries between physical and virtual reality, enabling users to interact with both digital and real-world elements in a shared, persistent space.&#x20;

**Related Topics:**

* **AR and VR Integration:** AR and VR technologies are core components of the Phygital Metaverse, allowing users to experience immersive digital environments and interact with physical surroundings using headsets or mobile devices.
* **Digital Twins:** Digital twins are digital representations or avatars of physical objects, spaces, or even individuals. They enable synchronization between the physical and digital realms within the metaverse.
* **Spatial Computing:** Spatial computing combines computer vision and augmented reality to enable real-time mapping of physical spaces, creating a foundation for interactions between physical and digital entities.
* **Interconnected Virtual Worlds:** The Phygital Metaverse envisions multiple interconnected virtual worlds or realms, each with its unique environment, rules, and experiences. Users can seamlessly transition between these virtual spaces.
* **Spatial Experiences and Events:** The Phygital Metaverse hosts spatially-driven experiences, events, and exhibitions, where users can participate, explore, and engage with digital and physical elements simultaneously.

## Other

**IoT:** The Internet of Things (IoT) devices and sensors are integrated into the metaverse, enabling the tracking and interaction with physical objects and environments in real-time.
