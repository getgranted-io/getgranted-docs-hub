# ðŸ”– Glossary

**Client-side Development:** Focuses on creating user-facing applications and interfaces that interact with blockchain technology for an improved user experience.

**Smart Contracts:** Involves creating self-executing contracts with the terms directly written into code, enabling trustless and automated agreements on the blockchain.

**Protocol Development:** Centers on developing and enhancing the underlying protocols and algorithms that form the backbone of blockchain networks, ensuring security, efficiency, and scalability.

**Development Networks & Node Management:** Concerns the creation and maintenance of networks and nodes that support the blockchain infrastructure, ensuring robustness and reliability.

**Tooling:** Involves developing tools and utilities that aid developers in building, testing, and deploying blockchain applications more efficiently.

**Cryptographic Research and Development:** Focuses on advancing the security and efficiency of blockchain systems through innovative cryptographic techniques, including encryption, consensus algorithms, and privacy-preserving technologies.

## Blockchain

**Sidechain:** A sidechain is an independent blockchain that operates separately from the Network, such as Ethereum Mainnet, yet remains connected to it through a two-way bridge. Distinct from layer 2 scaling solutions, sidechains maintain their independence by not sending state changes and transaction data back to the Mainnet. This structure allows sidechains to function autonomously while still being linked to the network's ecosystem.

**Yield Farming**: Users can stake their on-chain assets such as tokens or in-game assets (NFTs) to earn additional rewards.

**NFT Drops**: Exclusive Non-Fungible Token (NFT) assets that are distributed to users/players as rewards.

**NFT Marketplaces**: Integration with NFT marketplaces like OpenSea or Rarible for trading on-chain assets.

**Decentralized Autonomous Organizations (DAOs)**: Users collectively govern network / application roadmap decisions and management assets through community governance.

## Gaming

**P2E / Play to Earn:** P2E is a game mechanic where players can earn cryptocurrency or digital assets by actively participating in a game. This can include completing quests, winning battles, or achieving in-game objectives that result in tangible rewards. Players are incentivized to spend time and effort within the game to accumulate valuable assets.

**P2O (Play to Own):** P2O is a game mechanic that allows players to own in-game assets as true digital property. These assets are typically represented as NFTs on the blockchain, providing players with full ownership rights. Players can buy, sell, and trade these assets freely, creating a player-driven virtual economy.
